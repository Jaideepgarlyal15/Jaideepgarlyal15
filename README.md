## About Me

I am a Data Scientist and Analyst with a focus on financial modelling, machine learning, and data engineering. My work brings together analytical depth and practical execution to solve problems across finance, technology, and business operations. I am currently completing a Master’s in Data Science and Innovation at UTS Sydney and working as a Research Analyst, where I evaluate companies, build predictive models, and translate complex datasets into strategic insights.

My background spans AI engineering, equity research, sales leadership, and real estate strategy. This unique mix allows me to understand business problems from both a commercial and a technical angle. I am driven by precision, clarity, and producing work that delivers measurable value.

I am open to collaborating on large scale machine learning systems, finance and investment analytics, applied AI, risk modelling, and research projects.
