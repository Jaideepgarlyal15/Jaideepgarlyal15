## About Me

I am a Data Scientist and Analyst focused on machine learning, financial modelling, and data engineering. I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science and Innovation at UTS Sydney. My work bridges academic rigor with real industry outcomes, combining research-driven insights with practical execution.

I enjoy developing end-to-end machine learning systems, analysing complex datasets, and building products that support strategic decision-making in finance and technology. My background also includes strong commercial experience in sales, lead generation, and customer relationship management, giving me a balanced technical and business-oriented profile.

I am open to collaborating on projects related to machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, financial analytics, and data engineering.
