## About

I work at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and financial analysis.

I am completing a Master’s in Data Science and Innovation at UTS Sydney and working as a Research Analyst, where I model ASX listed companies, study markets, and build forecasting workflows in Python and SQL. My background also includes AI engineering, sales leadership, and real estate, which gives me a commercial view of how data products must perform in reality.

If a problem involves noisy data, risk, or money, that is usually where I fit.
