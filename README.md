## Who I Am

I work at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and financial analysis.  
I care about three things: clean data, honest models, and outputs that decision makers can actually use.

I am completing a Master’s in Data Science and Innovation at UTS Sydney while working as a Research Analyst, where I combine Python, SQL, and financial modelling to study ASX listed companies and market behaviour. Before this, I built production ML systems as an AI Engineer and learnt how revenue really moves by working hands on in sales and real estate.

If a problem involves messy data, uncertainty, money, or all three, that is usually where I fit.

- Build machine learning workflows for forecasting, classification, and decision support  
- Design data pipelines and deployment paths with Airflow, Snowflake, dbt, Docker, and Azure  
- Translate technical work into clear stories for investors, managers, and non technical stakeholders
